- At least 3 levels
- UI.
- At least 4 spells.

- Spells can be upgraded or combined.

### Inspirations:
- Vampire Survivors

### Theme Interpretation:
- A cute demon has been called to Earth to help humans fight off monsters. A price is rewarded each time, perhaps gold or souls.

### Game Experience:
- MMO-inspired combat system,
- Vampire-Survivors-Like level design.
- 3D, camera is positioned above at an off-angle.
- WASD-keys to move, control camera with right click mouse and scroll wheel, left-click to target enemies, numkeys to choose spell.
- Casual with ramped-up difficulty for players who want it.
- Casual elements, such as pets and base-building.
